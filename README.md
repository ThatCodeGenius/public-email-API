Next.js Boilerplate API
This is the Next.js Boilerplate API project hosted on Vercel. It provides a clean and minimal foundation for building scalable, modern applications with Next.js. It comes pre-configured with essential features like routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and API routes, making it an ideal starting point for your Next.js-based projects.

Features
Next.js for React-based development
Server-side rendering (SSR) for optimal SEO and fast initial loads
API routes support to handle server-side logic
Minimalistic, clean code structure for rapid development
Pre-configured with modern development tools and linting
Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
Node.js (v16.0 or later)
npm or yarn package manager
A Vercel account (if you want to deploy the app)
Getting Started
Clone the Repository
To get started with this API, you first need to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/thatcodegenius-projects/nextjs-boilerplate.git
Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:
cd nextjs-boilerplate
npm install
# or if using Yarn:
yarn install
Run the Project Locally
You can run the application locally using the following command:
npm run dev
# or if using Yarn:
yarn dev
The app should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000. You can open this URL in your browser to see the live project.
API Routes
This Next.js boilerplate comes with built-in support for API routes. You can create custom API routes by adding JavaScript (or TypeScript) files inside the pages/api/ directory.
Example API Route:
To create a simple API endpoint, follow these steps:
1.Create a file in the pages/api/ directory, e.g., hello.js:
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
}
1.You can then access this endpoint at http://localhost:3000/api/hello.
Environment Variables
You can configure environment-specific variables for your project by creating a .env.local file in the root directory of the project. Some common examples include:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
Important:
Prefix public environment variables with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for them to be exposed to the browser.
Private environment variables like API keys should not be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ to keep them secure.
Deployment
You can easily deploy this project to Vercel for production use. Follow these steps:
1.Create an account on Vercel.
2.Push your project to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
3.Connect your repository to Vercel via the Vercel dashboard.
4.Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js project and deploy it.
For more detailed instructions, refer to the official Vercel documentation.
